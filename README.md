```

### Use a File as the Comment Body üìÇ

```yml
    - name: Create comment from markdown file
      uses: GrantBirki/comment@vX.X.X
      with:

      uses: GrantBirki/comment@vX.X.X
      with:

        vars: |
          sha: ${{ github.sha }}
          environment: production
          app: cool-app
```

> This will create a comment and use the markdown file contents as the comment body with the variables specified in the vars section for template rendering

For more information about **templating**, be sure to check out the [templating](#templating) section below

### Inputs üì•

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`issues: write`, `pull-requests: write`) or a `repo` scoped [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) | true | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `repository` | The full name of the repository in which to create or update a comment | true | `${{ github.repository }}` |
| `issue-number` | The number of the issue or pull request in which to create a comment | true | `${{ github.event.issue.number }}` |
| `comment-id` | The id of the comment to update | false |  |
| `body` | The comment body (string) | false | |
| `file` | The path to a file to use as a comment body | false | |
| `vars` | Template variables in yaml format for rendering with a provided file | false | |
| `edit-mode` | The mode when updating a comment, `replace` or `append` | false | `append` |
| `reactions` | A comma separated list of reactions to add to the comment (`+1`, `-1`, `laugh`, `confused`, `heart`, `hooray`, `rocket`, `eyes`) | | |

#### Outputs üì§

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `comment-id` | The ID of the created comment |

The ID of the created comment will be output for use in later steps
Note that in order to read the step output the action step must have an id.

```yml
    - name: Create comment
      uses: GrantBirki/comment@vX.X.X
      id: comment
      with:
        body: hello world

    - name: Check outputs
      run: echo "Comment ID - ${{ steps.comment.outputs.comment-id }}"
```

### Templating

There are two ways to leverage templates using this Action:

- Simple Template - Just pass in a `file: <path>` to the Action
- Template Rendering - Pass in a `file: <path>` and `vars: <values>` to the Action

`file` and `vars` explained:

- `file` is the path to a markdown file in your repository to load as a template
- `vars` are template variables to use when rendering your markdown file template

The `vars` input is a yaml string that will be parsed and converted to a map of key/value pairs. An example can be seen below:

```yml
  vars: |
    sha: ${{ github.sha }}
    environment: production
    app: cool-app
```

This Action uses [nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) to render template files with the `vars` variables provided. You can fully leverage all the features nunjucks has to offer to custimize templates to your heart's content.

An example of a markdown template file can be seen [here](demo/render-sample.md). When this Action runs, it will render the `demo/render-sample.md` file with the `vars` provided to dynamically generate the comment body!

You can even pass in GitHub Actions context variables as seen above (ex: `${{ github.sha }}`)

### Where to Find the ID of a Comment üîç

> How to find the id of a comment will depend a lot on the use case

Here is one example where the id can be found in the `github` context during an `issue_comment` event:

```yml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  commentCreated:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Add reaction
        uses: GrantBirki/comment@vX.X.X
        with:
          comment-id: ${{ github.event.comment.id }}
          reactions: eyes
```

### Error: Resource not Accessible by Integration ‚ùå

Common causes can be seen below

#### Workflow triggered from a fork

In *public* repositories this action does not work in `pull_request` workflows when triggered by forks

Any attempt will be met with the error, `Resource not accessible by integration`

#### Insufficient Permissions

This Action needs `write` access to issue, pull requests, or both depending on how you are using it:

```yml
permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### Accessing Issues and Comments in other Repositories üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

You can create and update comments in another repository by using a [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The user associated with the PAT must have write access to the repository

### Inspiration üå†

This Action was largely inspired by the [create-or-update-comment](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-or-update-comment) Action by [@peter-evans](https://github.com/peter-evans). In fact, it shared the majority of the code with that Action. The reason this Action was created was because a comment Action was needed that supported template rendering and was not available in the `create-or-update-comment`. It was suggested to use a second Action [render-template](https://github.com/chuhlomin/render-template) and pass the outputs of that Action into the `create-or-update-comment` Action.

This Action solves that problem by using the [nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) package for full template rendering
